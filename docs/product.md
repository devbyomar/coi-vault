# COI Vault — Product Definition

## One-Sentence Pitch

Track vendor certificates of insurance, expirations, and compliance in one place — with reminders and audit logs.

## Target Customers

- **Property managers** — managing vendor compliance across multiple properties
- **Condo boards** — ensuring contractor coverage is always current
- **Small general contractors** — tracking subcontractor insurance documentation

## Core Problem

These teams manually track vendor COIs in spreadsheets and miss expirations, leaving them exposed to liability gaps.

## Solution

A simple, focused B2B SaaS that:
1. Stores vendor information and their insurance documents
2. Tracks expiry dates with clear visual indicators
3. Sends automated email reminders before documents expire
4. Maintains a full audit trail for compliance

## Key Differentiators

- **Purpose-built** — not a generic document manager
- **Affordable** — starts free, scales with plan tiers
- **Simple** — no training needed, works in minutes
- **Compliant** — audit logs satisfy B2B requirements

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- We do **not** provide insurance or legal advice
- We do **not** evaluate policy coverage
- We do **not** underwrite or broker insurance
- We are a **workflow and document tracking tool only**
